Description: Install older versions of Bioconductor based on the R version
  currently installed in the system. The package relies on BiocManager to
  install packages but makes sure that CRAN package versions are downloaded
  from RSPM snapshots. These snapshots will conincide with the last published
  built date of the requested Bioconductor version.
